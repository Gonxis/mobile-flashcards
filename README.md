# Mobile Flashcards

Mobile Flashcards is a mobile application (Android or iOS - or both) that allows users to study collections of flashcards. The app allows users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, then take quizzes on those decks.

## üöÄ How to use

- Install with `yarn`. `npm install` or `npm i` is giving error in my project, please, install with yarn instead.
- Run `expo start` to try it out.

### Scripts

- `yarn start`: runs the app in development mode
- `yarn run ios`: builds the app for iOS
- `yarn run test`: runs the test watcher in an interactive mode
- `yarn run eject`: ejects the app so you have full control over configuration files and transitive dependencies
